		Input		Output
test1		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero, revealed tiles with no nearby mines are denoted by an empty space, and revealed tiles with nearby mines are denoted by their respective number
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		2		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		2 		(prints new state of minefield, user hits mine)
				"You've hit a mine! GAME OVER!"
				

test2		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		-1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		-1		"Not valid coordinate!"
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		100		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		100		"Not valid coordinate!"
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		0		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		0		"Not valid coordinate!" (fixed to not allow x or y less than 1)
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		11		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		11		"Not valid coordinate!" (fixed to not allow x or y greater than 10)
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		(prints new state of minefield, game continues as normal)
			

test3		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		(prints new state)
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Not valid coordinate!" (fixed to not allow the user to enter the same coordinate twice)
