		Input		Output
test1		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero, revealed tiles with no nearby mines are denoted by an empty space, and revealed tiles with nearby mines are denoted by their respective number
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		2		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		2 		(prints new state of minefield, user hits mine)
				"You've hit a mine! GAME OVER!"
				

test2		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		-1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		-1		ERROR (code ends)


test3		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		100		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		100		ERROR (code ends)
		
test4		1		prints a 10x10 minefield where all non-revealed tiles are denoted by zero
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		0		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		0		prints the minefield with no change, even though 0,0 is not a coordinate. this does not break the code since the minefield is bigger than is printed
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		11		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		11		prints the minefield with no change, even though 11,11 is not a coordinate. this does not break the code since the minefield is bigger than is printed
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		(prints new state of minefield)
				"Type the x-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		"Type the y-value of the coordinate you wish to uncover: "
		1		prints minefield with no change. game allows uncovered coordinates to be selected again.
